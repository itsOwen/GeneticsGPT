# 🧬 GeneticsGPT 🔬

GeneticsGPT is a powerful and intuitive application that leverages the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model to provide insights and answers to genetic and disease-related questions. With its user-friendly interface and integration with the [Open Targets](https://platform.opentargets.org/) genetics database, this application makes it easy to explore and understand complex genetic information.

## 💡 Why Open Targets

GeneticsGPT is a GPT-based search engine to translate natural language queries into valid GraphQL queries. This empowers users to easily explore and extract insights from the Open Targets dataset as currently Open Targets lacks a sophisticated search engine for complex queries, so this tool becomes very useful for drug discovery and genetics research.
